Rock Paper Scissors - The Odin Project

This project allowed me to see holistically how HTML/CSS/JS interact. I utilized the DOM to create new HTML elements and to call upon existing HTML elements. 
I took this project further by incorporating simple animations prior to the start of the game.

My greatest challenge was ensuring that events fired and were displayed only after certain events had terminated. 
To address this issue, I learned that utilizing setTimeouts/setInterval was key for implementing that functionality.
